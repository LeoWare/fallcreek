##Application project for Web Development in Fall Creek, OR

###Requirements:
1. Setup a small PHP application that echos the page
generation time and how much memory it took to generate
(demonstrates PHP skills - bonus points for using
ZF2/Symfony).
2. Create a 'live clock' on the page using javascript
(demonstrates simple javascript usage - bonus points for
using jQuery written yourself, no cheating with using
someone else's plugin!).
3. Put a picture of a cute animal, or bacon, somewhere on
the page (demonstrates simple HTML/CSS - bacon is tasty,
bonus points for making the bacon draggable and have it
disappear when dropped on the animal. An 'om nom nom'
alert would be nice too).
